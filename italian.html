        <br>
        <p>Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.

            Italian cuisine offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most influential cuisines on United States culinary. </p>

                    Turn the heat on the pan down to low and add heavy cream. Slowly bring the cream to a boil and then lower to a simmer. 
                    Allow cream to reduce for about 10 minutes, then add parmesan cheese and stir until it is completely combined with the sauce. 
                    Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water before draining pasta, and add 1/4 cup of pasta water to the sauce. 
                    If the sauce is too thin, continue to simmer until it is your desired thickness. 
                    If sauce is too thick, add more water to thin it out. Finally, stir pasta into sauce and serve with extra parmesan cheese and black pepper on top.
