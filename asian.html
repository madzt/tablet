                <h2>Panang Curry</h2>
                <p>Do not shake coconut milk before using so that a layer of coconut cream forms at the top of the can. 
                    Heat the cream in the top of the can over high heat for about 1 minute. 
                    When the cream starts bubbling, add the curry paste and stir them to mix. 
                    Cook paste for 1-2 minutes. Next, add onion and bay leaves and stir until coated with the paste. 
                    Cook for 3-4 minutes until the onions have softened. 
                    Then, stir in the rest of the coconut milk and heat until it boils. 
                    Boil the milk until it coats the back of a spoon, 15-20 minutes. 
                    Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the chicken, lime juice, fish sauce, and sugar. 
                    Cook for 5 minutes, then add the bell pepper and zucchini. 
                    Cook for about 5 more minutes until the chicken is cooked through.

                <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Wash rice in strainer until the water runs clear. Add the rice and 2 cups water in a small pot and heat until the water boils. Once the water is boiling, turn down to a simmer and cover the rice for 15-20 minutes. In a bowl, mix the vinegar, sugar, and salt, and stir until the sugar and salt have dissolved. After the rice has cooled for 10 minutes, pour the rice into the bowl and mix it with the vinegar. In a small bowl, melt the butter and stir in salt, pepper, and garlic powder for the lobster. Brush the butter over the lobster, then bake for 12-15 minutes, until the lobster is fully cooked and no longer rubbery. Roughly chop the imitation crabmeat, and mix it with the mayo in a small bowl. Cover a sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap, then place a sheet of nori on the plastic wrap. Cover the nori with rice, wetting your hands with water before adding the rice to prevent it from sticking. Next, add 1/3 of the crab mixture in a thin line about one inch from the end of the nori sheet. Then, add 1/3 of the cucumber in a thin line next to the crabmeat and add 1/3 of the avocado in a thin line next to the cucumber. Using the rolling mat and plastic wrap, roll the nori around the filling and press to seal. Continue until you have formed a sushi roll. Cut the roll into 6 or 8 bite-sized pieces. Repeat with the  other 2 nori sheets and and the rest of the filling ingredients. Lay the sushi pieces close together on a plate. Chop the baked lobster into small pieces and layer it on top of the sushi. Mix the extra mayo and sriracha in a bowl to make spicy mayo. Top sushi with eel sauce and spicy mayo.</p>
